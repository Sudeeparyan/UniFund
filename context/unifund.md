### **UniFund Overview**

* UniFund is "The Financial Assistant for students".


* It is a community-driven financial app that gamifies saving through leader boards, streaks, and shared student money hacks.



### **The Problem**

* 1. Lack of Saving Motivation: Students struggle to consistently save without accountability or incentives.


* 2. Poor Spending Awareness: There is no clear visibility of runway, savings progress, or real-time expense behaviour.


* 3. Scattered Student Benefits: Cheap deals, offers, and money-saving hacks are fragmented across multiple platforms.


* 4. Exchange Rate Uncertainty: Students lose money due to poor timing in currency exchange decisions.



### **What Students Actually Ask**

* How long will my money last? 


* Am I saving enough compared to others? 


* Where can I spend less? 


* When should I exchange currency? 


* What student offers am I missing? 


* UniFund answers these through runway prediction, social savings leader board, community-shared cheap discoveries, ML-based exchange suggestions, and aggregated student deals with grocery optimization.



### **Product — UniFund Core Features**

* 1. Social Savings Scoreboard: Ranks friends based on savings, creating competition and accountability.


* 2. Runway Predictor: Shows how many days money will last at current spending rate.


* 3. Smart Expense Tracking: Manual and photo-based tracking with real-time savings visibility.


* 4. Student Deals & Grocery Optimiser: Finds cheapest supermarkets, products, and exclusive student offers.


* 5. Currency Exchange Advisor: ML-based suggestions on optimal timing for currency exchange.



### **Engagement & Behaviour Mechanics**

* UniFund goes beyond tracking — it builds habits and rewards sensible choices.


* 
**Savings-meter:** Socially visible progress towards savings goals.


* 
**Streak rewards:** Short-run streaks incentivize consistent runway-positive behaviours.


* 
**Coupon incentives:** Targeted offers from student-friendly brands that extend runway.



### **Business Impact & Monetization**

* 
**High frequency use → retention:** Daily runway checks build habit loops; retention anchors lifetime value starting in college.


* 
**Multi-channel revenue:** Subscription tiers + student offers, brand partnerships.


* 
**Affiliate revenue:** UniFund earns affiliate commission when students purchase groceries, student offers, or financial services through in-app partner links.



### **Financial Data & Projections**

* 
**Student Monthly Spending Breakdown (£1,142):**
