I need to imrpove it give me list

1. AI-Driven Budgeting & "Runway" Management
These features form the core financial engine, automating the tedious parts of budgeting so the user actually sticks to it.

Predictive Runway Calculator: Retain this from your original list. It must dynamically calculate exactly how many days or months of liquid capital remain before hitting zero, forcing immediate financial awareness.


Foreign Exchange (FX) Timing Alerts: Tracks the live mid-market exchange rate between the student's home currency and the Euro. It sends a push notification when the home currency is historically strong, advising the student that it is the optimal time to transfer large sums for rent or tuition.


2. Hyper-Local Deal Aggregation & Geolocation
Students miss out on thousands of euros simply because they do not know a discount exists. Your app should bring the savings directly to them.

Unified Discount Hub: Aggregate offers from major platforms (like UNiDAYS and Student Beans) alongside localized, independent shop discounts.

Location-Based Deal Pings: Utilize the phone's GPS. If a student walks past a business with a verified student discount (for example, passing Boojum or Umi Falafel), the app pushes a notification reminding them to show their student ID for a cheaper meal.

Transport Mode Optimizer: The app monitors transit spending. If a student is spending €80 a month tapping a Student Leap Card on the Luas or bus, the app calculates the savings of switching to an annual Dublin Bikes subscription (€35/year) and prompts them to make the switch.

Page name :- Community page
This feature utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to constantly scan the community feed, categorize posts by intent (Seeking vs. Offering), extract key data points (Location, Dates, Budget), and instantly connect users via automated comments.

How the Logic Works (The User Flow)
Intent Recognition: The AI reads every new community post. It determines if the user is a "Supplier" (offering a room) or a "Seeker" (looking for a room).

Entity Extraction: It pulls out the vital statistics: Dublin 1, 3 months, temporary, €800/month.

The Automated Handshake (AI Comment): When a "Seeker" posts, the AI queries the database for matching "Supplier" posts. Within seconds, the AI leaves a highly personalized, helpful comment directly on the Seeker's post, linking them to the Supplier.

Human Verification: Other students can still comment naturally, upvote the AI's suggestion, or warn if a specific building has issues.

Example Scenario (The Hackathon Demo)
To present this effectively, map out the exact user interface flow for the judges:

Step 1: The Supplier Post (User A)

User A (Rahul): "Hey everyone, I'm heading back to India for 3 months (June to August). I need someone to take over my room in a shared apartment in Dublin 1 near Parnell Street. €750 a month, bills included."
Behind the scenes: The AI tags this post as [OFFERING] [DUBLIN 1] [3 MONTHS] [€750].

Step 2: The Seeker Post (User B)

User B (Priya): "Need a room accommodation required in Dublin 01. Looking for something short-term just for the summer while I do my internship!"

Step 3: The AI Intervention

AI Matchmaker (Automated Comment on Priya's post): > "Hi Priya! I noticed you are looking for short-term accommodation in Dublin 1.

@Rahul posted 2 days ago that he is subletting his room in Dublin 1 for 3 months at €750/month while he travels.

Safety Reminder: Always view the property in person and verify the primary lease before transferring any deposits!"

Priority B: Behavioral Engineering & Smart Community
These features keep the user opening the app every single day and leverage the community to solve expensive problems.

AI Bureaucracy & Triage ChatBot: Answers complex, localized questions instantly. (e.g., "How do I apply for my IRP card?" or "What is the cheapest way to get from the airport to student housing?").

Gamified Frugality (Streaks & Rewards): Users maintain a "streak" for staying under their daily budget. Hitting milestones unlocks tangible rewards, like a digital coupon for a free coffee on campus.

The AI Sublet Matchmaker: Your community board idea, supercharged. When a student posts "I am going to India for 3 months," the AI automatically tags the location, dates, and price. When a new student posts looking for a room, the AI instantly connects them in the comments, eliminating the need for expensive short-term hotel stays.

Anti-Scam Lease Verifier: Users upload screenshots of Facebook housing ads or lease agreements. The AI scans the text for illegal deposit demands or flags it if the address matches a known Dublin scam database.


Priority C: The Zero-Capital Ecosystem
These features allow students to acquire things they need without spending actual currency.

Automated Micro-Debt (Splitwise Integration): Seamlessly splits shared utility bills and household supplies among roommates, sending automatic nudges so the user never loses money to forgetful housemates.

Seniors' "Starter Kit" Handover: A specialized section of the secondhand market. Graduating students leaving Ireland bundle their entire room setup (desk, lamp, winter coat, hangers) and sell it as a single heavily discounted package to an incoming fresher.

The Skill-Barter Board: A cashless marketplace. Students trade favors instead of money. For example, trading a home-cooked meal for an hour of coding help or a haircut.
